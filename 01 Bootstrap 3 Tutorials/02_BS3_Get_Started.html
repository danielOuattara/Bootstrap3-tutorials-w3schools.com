<!-- What is Bootstrap ?
========================

> Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development

> Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms,
  buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well
  as optional JavaScript plugins

> Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs


What is Responsive Web Design ?
===============================

  Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust
  themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.


Bootstrap History
=================

  Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, and
  released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.

  In June 2014 Bootstrap was the No.1 project on GitHub!
  Why Use Bootstrap?


Advantages of Bootstrap:
========================

  > Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start
    ------------  using Bootstrap

  > Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets,
    -------------------- and desktops

  > Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the
    ---------------------  core framework

  > Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers
    ---------------------- (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, 
                           and Opera)


Where to Get Bootstrap ?
========================

There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.

You can:
         > Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com

         > Include Bootstrap from a CDN


Downloading Bootstrap
=======================

If you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com,
and follow the instructions there.


Bootstrap CDN
==============

If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it
from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also 
include jQuery:


One advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN:
=========================================

Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another
site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site,
which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once
a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to
them, which also leads to faster loading time.


jQuery
=======

Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc).
However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.


Create First Web Page With Bootstrap
=====================================

1. Add the HTML5 DOCTYPE
-------------------------
Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 '!DOCTYPE'.
Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the
'lang' attribute and the correct 'charset':
____________________________
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
</html>
____________________________


2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
------------------------------
Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles
are part of the core framework.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag
inside the <head> element:
______________________________________________________________________
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
______________________________________________________________________

The 'width=device-width' part sets the width of the page to follow the
screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The 'initial-scale=1' part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first
loaded by the browser.

3. Containers
--------------
Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two container classes to choose from:

 1- '.container' class provides a responsive 'fixed width container'

 2- '.container-fluid' class provides a 'full width container', spanning the
    entire width of the viewport

Two Basic Bootstrap Pages
===========================
The following example shows the code for a basic Bootstrap page
(with a responsive 'fixed width container'):                                        -->

        
        <div class="jumbotron text-center">
          <h2>Boostrap 3</h2>
          <p>Resize this responsive page to see the effect</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h2>Boostrap Page</h2>
          <p>This part is inside a .container class.</p>
          <p>The .container class provides a responsive fixed width
             container.</p>
        </div>

<!-- The following example shows the code for a basic Bootstrap page
(with a full width container): -->


        <div class="container-fluid">
          <h2>Boostrap Page</h2>
          <p>This part is inside a .container-fluid class.</p>
          <p>The .container-fluid class provides a full width container,
             spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>
        </div>

</body>
